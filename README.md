        <h1>My Mush World</h1>
        <p>Hi I am Abdullah Fareed Qureshi. I love to explore new things. Today I am going to tell you about my mushroom project. This is actually inspired by the fact that 90% of the mushrooms in the world got wasted.</p>
        <p>Click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morchella">here </a> to see one of many wonderful species of mushrooms. This is what we called Guschi in Hamaliyan region. delicious and expensive.</p>

        <p>Let me tell you some benifits of mushrooms</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Boosts immune system: Mushrooms contain compounds like beta-glucans that help the immune system function more
            efficiently.</li>
            <li>Promotes gut health: They are a source of prebiotics, which feed beneficial gut bacteria, and some types may even
            contain helpful bacteria that improve digestion.</li>
            <li>Protects brain health: Antioxidants and B vitamins in mushrooms support brain function. Regular consumption may also
            lower the risk of mild cognitive impairment.</li>
            <li>Supports heart health: Some mushrooms, like shiitake, can help lower cholesterol levels.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I want to share some imaged of Morchella mushrooms with you.</p>
